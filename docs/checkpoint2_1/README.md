# Checkpoint 2.1: Location Management Improvements

## Overview
This checkpoint implements comprehensive improvements to the location management system, including verification, search filters, bulk import, clustering, photos, categories/tags, duplicate detection, community moderation, and user reputation.

## Completed Features

### 1. Verification System
- Added verification fields to ViewingLocation model:
  - `is_verified`: Boolean flag for verified locations
  - `verification_date`: When location was verified
  - `verified_by`: User who verified the location
  - `verification_notes`: Notes about verification
  - `times_reported`: Counter for reports
  - `last_visited`: Last visit timestamp
  - `visitor_count`: Number of unique visitors

### 2. Advanced Search & Filtering
- Created `ViewingLocationFilter` class with comprehensive filters:
  - Quality score range filtering
  - Light pollution value filtering
  - Verification status filtering
  - Location-based radius search
  - Time-based filters (recently visited, date ranges)
  - Category and tag filtering
  - Minimum rating and review count filters
  - Photo availability filter (placeholder)

### 3. Bulk Location Import
- Created `BulkLocationImportSerializer` for CSV/JSON imports
- Features:
  - Dry run mode for validation
  - Duplicate detection within import and against database
  - Support for both file upload and direct data
  - Detailed validation and error reporting
  - Batch creation for efficiency

### 4. Location Clustering
- Implemented `ClusteringService` for map performance:
  - Dynamic clustering based on zoom level
  - Haversine distance calculations
  - Bounds-based filtering
  - Cluster statistics (average quality, verification status)
  - Grid-based clustering algorithm

### 5. Photo Upload System
- Created `LocationPhoto` model with:
  - Image upload with unique paths
  - Caption and metadata support
  - Primary photo designation
  - Approval workflow (auto-approved for now)
  - EXIF data fields (for future implementation)
- Added photo-related endpoints:
  - Upload photo to location
  - Get all photos for location
  - Set primary photo

### 6. Categories & Tags
- Created `LocationCategory` model:
  - Pre-defined categories (Park, Mountain, Desert, etc.)
  - Icons and descriptions
  - Default categories populated via migration
- Created `LocationTag` model:
  - User-generated tags
  - Usage counting
  - Approval workflow
  - Creator tracking

### 7. Duplicate Detection
- Automatic duplicate checking on location creation
- Manual duplicate checking endpoint
- Configurable radius for duplicate detection (default 500m)
- Force create option to override duplicate warnings
- Duplicate reporting functionality

### 8. Community Moderation
- Created `LocationReport` model:
  - Multiple report types (Duplicate, Inaccurate, Spam, etc.)
  - Status tracking (Pending, Reviewed, Resolved, Dismissed)
  - Unique constraint to prevent spam
  - Moderator review workflow
- Report endpoints:
  - Submit report about location
  - View reports (admin only)

### 9. User Reputation System
- Added reputation fields to UserProfile:
  - `reputation_score`: Overall score
  - `verified_locations_count`: Verified locations by user
  - `helpful_reviews_count`: Reviews with positive votes
  - `quality_photos_count`: Approved photos
  - `is_trusted_contributor`: Status flag (score >= 100)
- Reputation calculation based on:
  - Locations added (10 points each)
  - Verified locations (20 bonus points)
  - Reviews (5 points each)
  - Helpful reviews (2 points per net upvote)
  - Photos (8 points each)
  - Approved tags (15 points each)
- Management command to update reputations

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/viewing-locations/bulk_import/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "format": "json",
    "dry_run": true,
    "data": [
      {
